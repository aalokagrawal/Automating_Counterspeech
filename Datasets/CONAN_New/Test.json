    "409": "We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?",

    "512": "Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?",
    "513": "For hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of Churches in Britain, but we are better than that now.",
    "514": "Surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! Read on. Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahor, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Karachi.",

    "520": "I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?",
    "521": "There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding.",
    "522": "What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. Islam condemns violence.",
    "523": "Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide.",

    "536": "Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy.",
    "537": "Don't mix up politics and faith. No faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story.",

    "551": "That is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more.",
    "552": "Or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us.",
    "553": "Violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text.",

    "555": "Ha, well you never went to public school then!",
    "556": "Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.",
    "557": "Well, when the pope who represents 1.2 billion catholics and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood,\" i know who i will believe. Stop just listening to the news you want to believe.",

    "561": "Violence is a muslim issue. Especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination.",
    "562": "Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.",

    "570": "Muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers.",
    "571": "Slavery long predated Islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. Way ahead of the rest of the world.",
    "572": "But the British turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world.",
    "573": "That is inaccurate, do your research! Slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world.",
    "574": "Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.",
    "575": "Slavery was widely dominant before Islam. Muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness.",
    "576": "That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.",
    "577": "No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.",
    "578": "Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?",
    "579": "Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.",
    "580": "I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime.",
    "581": "If that were true would not there only be one version of Islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. Just like Christianity it has different interpretations, there good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders.",
    "582": "No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions.",
    "583": "The Christian world can be far from tolerant. Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?",
    "584": "Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam.",
    "585": "It is no more totalitarian than any other religion. Only extremists using Islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. These aren't reflective of the majority of Muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so.",
    "586": "Islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world.",

    "590": "Oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others?",
    "591": "Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement.",
    "592": "I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much.",
    "593": "Why do you think Islam is evil? The major beliefs in Islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. For instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures.",
    "594": "The number of Muslims in the world is fast growing. Do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers?",
    "595": "Its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority.",
    "596": "I do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy?",
    "597": "Doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect?",
    "598": "Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!",
    "599": "Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'.",
    "600": "I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!",
    "601": "Stop Islam spreading? Why so negative? People of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. I do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations?",
    "602": "Probably you are making a hasty generalization. I do not think Islam is taking over countries and nations. Do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in UK? How many of them are from EU, muslim community, and other countries?",
    "603": "If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger.",
    "604": "No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'.",
    "605": "Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing.",
    "606": "Can I ask you what bad things Islam has brought to us? I cannot name any!",
    "607": "Have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions?",
    "608": "You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?",
    "609": "I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?",
    "610": "There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding.",
    "611": "What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. Islam condemns violence.",
    "612": "Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide.",
    "613": "Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos.",
    "614": "This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.",
    "615": "There is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white British- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of Muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work.",
    "616": "Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures.",
    "617": "Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?",
    "618": "Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?",
    "619": "Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).",
    "620": "How can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life?",
    "621": "According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little.",

    "625": "If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?",
    "626": "Do you really think this? So how otherwise they can support themselves?",
    "627": "That is not what I observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy.",
    "628": "If they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. So what is your problem.",
    "629": "How do you know this? Do you have any proof, official papers?",
    "630": "Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce.",
    "631": "Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!",
    "632": "That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market.",
    "633": "Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers.",
    "634": "The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics).",
    "635": "Where this misconception is coming from?",
    "636": "That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?",
    "637": "Have you spoken to or worked with a muslim?",
    "638": "This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'.",
    "639": "Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment.",
    "640": "All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?",
    "641": "Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.",
    "642": "Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions.",
    "643": "Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story.",
    "644": "Refuse to work do they? But at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. Tricky one that!",
    "645": "Provide unemployment data breakdown if possible.",
    "646": "If any Muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce.",
    "647": "How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.",
    "648": "Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them.",
    "649": "Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?",
    "650": "Around 12% of Muslims in the UK are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics.",
    "651": "Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority.",
    "652": "This is a sad matter, but not all Muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are Muslims.",
    "653": "This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?",
    "654": "Did you miss 'Some.' from the beginning of this Tweet?",
    "655": "I'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a Pakistani Muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly Muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue.",
    "656": "I feel you anger. The often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. Besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. Sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. Please help our girls: visit English National Domestic Violence Helpline and National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.",
    "657": "I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. That is what we should be stopping.",
    "658": "Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts.",
    "659": "People are people with evil ones in every community. Misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it.",
    "660": "That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases.",
    "661": "The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.",
    "662": "Really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? Lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse.",
    "663": "Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it.",
    "664": "Do you know, according to UK's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. This was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. Around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member.",
    "665": "Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.",
    "666": "Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. If you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not.",
    "667": "Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. It often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized.",
    "668": "I think the #CatholicChurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community.",

    "684": "Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.",
    "685": "There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.",

    "687": "I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?",
    "688": "Apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? So surely a country without Islam would be less 'religously' diverse?",
    "689": "I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'.",

    "717": "Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's.

    "720": "The truth is the worldwide Muslims denounce ISIS and its violence. Plus, many Muslims are the victims of ISIS.

    "749": "At most, children are just learning more about different religions. You are using very strong and unnecessary words here.",

    "754": "You cannot blame an entire faith.",

    "756": "Evidence?",
    "757": "Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes.",
    "758": "Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow.",
    "759": "What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?",
    "760": "Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no difference from us.",

    "762": "You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!",
    "763": "This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred.",

    "793": "What type of whims are you talking about? Laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled.",
    "794": "Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.",

    "796": "Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen.",

    "802": "I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced.",
    "803": "The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this.",
    "804": "Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures.",

    "810": "This person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it!",
    "811": "Can you not see how offensive this is? Just replace what you said with any other group of people.",
    "812": "Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!",
    "813": "This is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. Perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for.",
    "814": "If you do not think Muslims have ever done anything for 'us' I think you need to do a quick google search. The evidence of Muslims contributions to society is everywhere!",
    "815": "Provided the basis for all Western scientific and philosophical knowledge?",
    "816": "Are you talking about the Muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses?",
    "817": "How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?",
    "818": "That is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads.",
    "819": "Apart from the fact that you couldn't catch HIV like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds.",
    "820": "Cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?",
    "821": "Yes, except that HIV is more common among Christians and its not a contact disease.",
    "822": "This sounds like a science fiction if you ask me!",
    "823": "Fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. Need I go on?",
    "824": "95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk)",
    "825": "One of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. Maybe if you made Muslims feel more welcome, they would?",
    "826": "Many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported.",
    "827": "Maybe you are the one that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you?",
    "828": "A nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me.",
    "829": "What if somebody is UK citizen and muslim?",
    "830": "Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.",
    "831": "The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions.",
    "832": "Are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the Indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories?",
    "833": "This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?",
    "834": "The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted.",
    "835": "Is this true? Where is your source?",
    "836": "The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?",
    "837": "Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories.",
    "838": "Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people.",
    "839": "This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here.",
    "840": "Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes.",
    "841": "Evidence please? This is just hatred."
