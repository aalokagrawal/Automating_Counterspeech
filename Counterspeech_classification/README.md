1. **Discriminator_training.py**  -- It is used to train the model which predicts whether a piece of text is counterspeech or not. We have used the prediction probabilities as a metrics to evaluate the counterspeech generated by the models.

2. **Counterspeech_classification_model.ipynb** -- It is used to train a model which classifies the counterspeech into one of the six categories viz. Affiliation, Denouncing, Facts, Humour, Hypocrisy and Question. This is used to  evaluate the efficiency of various prompting strategies in generating different kinds of counterspeech.
